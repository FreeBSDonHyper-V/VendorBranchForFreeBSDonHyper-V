***** Release rc2.2.0 1/4/2012 ***************************************************

New features/limitations-

-Port of LIS 2.1 with FreeBSD support code from Citrix, drivers are linked with
 Kernel (future drivers will be loadable), port has not been refactored to meet
 BSD coding standards
 
-SCSI device driver functional, but support for scatter-gather lists is not
 implemented-Fast IDE support has not been added-still using emulated IDE
 support
 
-Network storage device support has been added

-While the storage and networking devices support multiple controllers, we're
 waiting on a resolution from Microsoft to enable persistent and consistent
 numbering between boots
  
-Hyper-V bus has been ported with support code from Citrix to handle clock
 synchronization between guest and host. Clock synchronization and heartbeat
 logic have been moved to two, separate drivers-this separation is part
 of the initial steps for refactoring and restructuring the Hyper-V bus driver from the
 LIS 2.1 codebase
 
Bug fixes-
